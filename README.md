*here Systems Engineering meets Security Research.*

Welcome to my digital workbench!

I am Joao Pedro N. Monteiro, a Cybersecurity Analyst and Computer Engineering student based in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. I have a background in Sysadmin, Linux, Malware Analysis and GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance), but my true passion is in uncovering and undertanding how the systems we as security practitioners protect - servers, databases, endpoints and IoT devices- truçy work under the hood, and their security implications.

This site serves as the central hub (and showroom) for my projects, usually linked to malware analysis, hardware hacking or IoT.

Why "Buffer Afterthought"? Because in C, like in life, if you don't manage your boundaries, you crash.

Here, you will find:

DevLogs: detailed, unvarnished chronicles of my ongoing projects (caution, may contain copious amount of rambling).

Deep Dives: explorations into Linux internals, kernel modules, malware binaries, networking protocols and weird vulnerable IoT devices.

The Struggle: I believe in Learning in Public. This means documenting not just the polished final product, but the segfaults, the burnt GPIO pins, and the logic errors along the way.

The Projects: The shiny and nice project pages where i try to sell you on an idea that most likely was born out of a post or video nerd-sniping me.

Consider this site my accountability mechanism. By documenting the process, I force myself to truly understand the code I write—or at least explain why it caught fire.

Grab a coffee, verify your checksums, and take a look around!
